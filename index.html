						"What we're seeing are the effects of climate change. Sometimes, it's said that Australia is the canary in the coal mine with the effects of climate change being seen here most severely and earliest… 
						We're probably looking at what climate change may look like for other parts of the world in the first stages in Australia at the moment,"

				<h2>Overview</h2>
				<p> 
					"As of 9 March 2020, the fires burnt an estimated 18.6 million hectares (46 million acres; 186,000 square kilometres; 72,000 square miles), 
					destroyed over 5,900 buildings (including 2,779 homes) and killed at least 34 people. An estimated one billion animals have been killed and some 
					endangered species may be driven to extinction. At its peak, air quality dropped to hazardous levels... The cost of dealing with the bushfires is 
					expected to exceed the A$4.4 billion of the 2009 Black Saturday fires, and tourism sector revenues fell below more than A$1 billion. By 7 January 2020, 
					the smoke had moved approximately 11,000 kilometres (6,800 mi) across the South Pacific Ocean to Chile and Argentina. As of 2 January 2020, 
					NASA estimated that 306 million tonnes (337 million short tons) of CO2 had been emitted." <a class ="source" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019%E2%80%9320_Australian_bushfire_season#Overview"> -Wikipedia (2019–20 Australian bushfire season)</a>
